Within the components folder, there are separate files for user authentication, including Login.jsx and Signup.jsx. Additionally, to manage product display and details, the application includes Product.jsx and ProductDetails.jsx files. The main component responsible for rendering these files is App.js, while index.js serves as the entry point to the application.
